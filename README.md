# Multi-Robot Collision Avoidance with Probabilistic Mahalanobis Distance Constraints
We present a probabilistic Mahalanobis distance constraint combined with MPPI algorithm to realize multi-robot system collision avoidance.

# Note
We haven't published the corresponding paper yet. Once the article is publicly available, we will further refine the code.
